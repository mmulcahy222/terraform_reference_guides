{"ibm-subnet": "<h1 id=\"ibm_subnet\">ibm_subnet</h1><p>This resource provides portable and static subnets that consist of either IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Users are able to create <br />public portable subnets, private portable subnets, and public static subnets with an IPv4 option, and public portable subnets and public static subnets with an IPv6 option. </p><p>The portable IPv4 subnet is created as a secondary subnet on a VLAN. IP addresses in the portable subnet can be assigned as secondary IP addresses for IBM resources in the VLAN. Because each portable subnet has a default gateway IP address, network IP address, and broadcast IP address, the number of usable IP addresses is <code>capacity</code> - 3. A <code>capacity</code> of 4 means that the number of usable IP addresses is 1; a <code>capacity</code> of 8 means that the number of usable IP addresses is 5. For example, consider a portable subnet of <code>10.0.0.0/30</code> that has <code>10.0.0.1</code> as a default gateway IP address, <code>10.0.0.0</code> as a network IP address, and <code>10.0.0.3</code> as a broadcast IP address. Only <code>10.0.0.2</code> can be assigned to IBM resources as a secondary IP address. </p><p>The static IPv4 subnet provides secondary IP addresses for primary IP addresses. It provides secondary IP addresses for IBM resources such as virtual servers, Bare Metal servers, and <code>NetscalerVPXs</code>. Consider a virtual server that requires secondary IP addresses. Users can create a static subnet on the public IP address of the virtual server. Unlike the portable subnet, the number of usable IP addresses for the static subnet is the same as the value of <code>capacity</code>. For example, when a static subnet of <code>10.0.0.0/30</code> has a <code>capacity</code> of 4, then four IP addresses (10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.3) can be used as secondary IP addresses. </p><p>Both the public portable IPv6 subnet and the public static IP only accept <code>64</code> as a value for the <code>capacity</code> attribute. They provide 2^64 IP addresses.
