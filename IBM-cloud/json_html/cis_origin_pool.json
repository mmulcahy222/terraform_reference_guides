Disabled pools do not receive network traffic and are excluded from health checks.

If the number of healthy origins falls within this number, the pool will be marked unhealthy and we will failover to the next available pool. Default: 1.<br />- <code>monitor</code> - (Optional, String) The ID of the monitor to use for health checking origins within this pool.<br />- <code>notification_email</code> - (Optional, String) The Email address to send health status notifications to.
