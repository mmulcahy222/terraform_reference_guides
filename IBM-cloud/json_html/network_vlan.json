There might be some resources (like Virtual Guests) on the VLAN. The VLAN delete request is issued once there are no Virtual Guests on the VLAN.</li></ul>", "argument-reference": "<h2 id=\"argument-reference\">Argument reference</h2><p>Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource.</p><ul><li><code>datacenter</code> - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The data center in which the VLAN resides.</li><li><code>type</code> - (Required, Forces new resource, String)The type of VLAN. Accepted values are <code>PRIVATE</code> and <code>PUBLIC</code>.</li><li><code>name</code> - (Optional, String) The name of the VLAN. Maximum length of 20 characters.</li><li><code>router_hostname</code> - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The hostname of the primary router associated with the VLAN.</li><li><code>tags</code> - (Optional, Array of string) Tags associated with the VLAN. Permitted characters include: A-Z, 0-9, whitespace, <code>_</code> (underscore), <code>-</code> (hyphen), <code>.</code> (period), and <code>:</code> (colon). All other characters are removed.</li></ul>", "attribute-reference": "<h2 id=\"attribute-reference\">Attribute reference</h2><p>In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.</p><ul><li><code>child_resource_count</code> - (String) A count of the resources, such as virtual servers and other network components, that are connected to the VLAN.</li><li><code>id</code> - (String) The unique identifier of the VLAN.</li><li><code>softlayer_managed</code> - (String) SoftLayer manages the VLAN. If SoftLayer creates the VLAN automatically when SoftLayer creates other resources, this attribute is set to <strong>true</strong>. If a user creates the VLAN by using the SoftLayer API, portal, or ticket, this attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>.</li><li><code>subnets</code> - (List) The collection of subnets associated with the VLAN.</li></ul><p>Nested scheme for <code>subnets</code>:<br />  - <code>cidr</code> - (String) A subnet Classless Inter-Domain Routing prefix. The number in the range of 0 - 32 signifying the number of bits in a subnet mask.<br />  - <code>gateway</code> - (String) A subnet gateway address.<br />  - <code>subnet</code> - (String) The subnet for the VLAN. .<br />  - <code>subnet-type</code> - (String) A subnet can be one of several types. <code>PRIMARY, ADDITIONAL_PRIMARY, SECONDARY, ROUTED_TO_VLAN, SECONDARY_ON_VLAN, STORAGE_NETWORK, and STATIC_IP_ROUTED</code>. A <code>PRIMARY</code> subnet is the primary network that is bound to a VLAN within the SoftLayer network. An <code>ADDITIONAL_PRIMARY</code> subnet is bound to a network VLAN to augment the pool of available primary IP addresses that might be assigned to a server. A <code>SECONDARY</code> subnet is any of the secondary subnets bound to a VLAN interface. A <code>ROUTED_TO_VLAN</code> subnet is a portable subnet that can be routed to any server on a VLAN. A <code>SECONDARY_ON_VLAN</code> subnet also doesn't exist as a VLAN interface, but is routed directly to a VLAN instead of a single IP address by SoftLayer's.<br />  - <code>subnet-size</code> - (String) The size of the subnet for the VLAN.<br />- <code>vlan_number</code> - (String) The VLAN number as recorded within the SoftLayer network. This attribute is configured directly on SoftLayer's networking equipment.</p>", "description": "<h1 id=\"ibm_network_vlan\">ibm_network_vlan</h1><p>Create, delete, and update an IBM Cloud network VLAN.
